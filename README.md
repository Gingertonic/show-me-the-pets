## Installation
To have a closer look, clone down the repo and cd into the directory:

To start the back end server run:

- `bundle install`
- `rake db:seed` to add the pets to the database!
- `rails s` to start up the back-end server on port 3002


And finally, to start the front end client:
- [`cd ..`]
- `cd show_me_the_pets_client`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Now you can navigate to the location shown (usually http://localhost:3000/) and enjoy!
